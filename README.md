# Image Processing Application

## Overview
This project is a web-based image processing application developed as a group project for the course SC205 under Prof. Manish K. Gupta. The application allows users to interactively apply various image processing techniques, facilitating real-time manipulation and analysis.

## Objectives
- Develop a user-friendly web application for dynamic image processing.
- Implement core image processing algorithms for real-time image enhancement.
- Create documentation and instructional materials to assist users in understanding the tool's functionality.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Processing**: Users can interactively manipulate images using various filters and effects.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Advanced algorithms such as Gaussian blurring, edge detection, and color extraction are integrated into the tool.
- **Documentation and Tutorials**: Comprehensive documentation is provided, along with a Google Site for project details and a YouTube video demonstrating the tool and explaining the underlying theory.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Core technologies used for the front-end development of the application.
- **Google Sites**: Utilized for presenting project details and functionalities.
- **YouTube**: A demonstration video is available for visual learners.
